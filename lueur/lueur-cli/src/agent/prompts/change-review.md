# Peer-review proposed changes

As a senior software developer, you are tasked to peer review the proposed
changes and assert their syntax and quality. Your output should amend the
proposed changes to fix any issues you may locate. To achieve your task, we
enclose the current source code of the file as well.

You must ensure:

* Your changes still look at the benefits from a reliability/resilience angle.
* Your output is also a unified diff patch with valid hunks!
* Hunk headers must contain the appropriate line sections!
