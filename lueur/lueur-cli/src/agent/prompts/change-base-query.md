# Task

Your task is to provide insightful feedback on how to make the application
much more resilient/reliable through very focused code changes.

These changes should be as close to possible to being applied as-is but, way
fundamentally, what matters is to help the developer understand what they need
to do to improve their code.

Given that somebody else might ask questions about each path, consider things like:

- What is the intent of this code?
- Does it lack mechanism to improve its reliability and resilience?
- Can we improve these facets without over-engineering the solution?

## Context

- Operation ID / Opid:  {{ opid }}
- Method:  {{ method }}
- Path: {{ path }}
- Idempotent: {{ idempotent }}
- Repository directory: {{ source_dir }}

##Â Good Solution Candidates

- Add retries with exponential backoff and a request-scoped timeout.
- Extend tracing and metrics to let operations be alerted as soon as possible.
- Potential refactor the code to be more reliable and resilient.
- Include link to resources that may provide more context.

## Advices

The following extensive report was generated by fault following a reliability
and resilience scenario which measures the capacity from a service to handle
various network failure scenarios. Use these advices to improve your response.

Go beyond the report's findings by analysing the actual code. The advices
report below focuses on how the application behaved with real traffic. Make
recommendations on the code itself as well.

The report is enclosed in a markdown code block below.
