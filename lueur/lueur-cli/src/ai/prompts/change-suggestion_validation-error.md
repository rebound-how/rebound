# Task

Your task is to generate unified diff changes for source code written in {{lang}}
from the weaknesses found by running the lueur tool and reported by OpenAPI
operation id, request method and path.

Given that somebody else might ask questions about each path, consider things like:

- What is the intent of this code?
- Does it lack mechanism to improve its reliability and resilience?
- Can we improve these facets without over-engineering the solution?
- ... and so on

# Objective

Implement a circuit-breaker (or middleware) plus graceful degradation and
improve logging around error paths.

# Context

- Operation ID / Opid:
- Method:
- Path:
- Idempotent: No

# Constraints

- Generate only unified diff appropriate to be applied by the `git` command
- Only respond in the appropriate programming language: {{lang}}.
- Ensure the proposed changes also include any dependencies modifications.
- Do NOT modify lock files.

# Example

Respond in the following example format and do not include anything else:

Q1: How can I gracefully handle temporary network issues?

You should choose well-known libraries appropriate for each language, for
instance for retry attempts:

Choose a library idiomatic to the language:

- **Python**: Tenacity
- **Go**: github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp
- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: axios-retry / fetch-retry
- **Rust**: tower::retry or the retry crate
- **Java**: resilience4j

If none apply, suggest an equivalent native mechanism.
