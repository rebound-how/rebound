## [0.1.69] - 2025-03-16

### Changed

- Removed git-cliff support as I couldn't make it work as I wanted. I'm going
  to try a different approach. Not generate automatically the changelog from
  commits but try to write it manually. I will also keep only the last entry
  here and copy it in its entirety as the release description.
