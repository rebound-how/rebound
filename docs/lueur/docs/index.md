lueur is here to help you uncover and address resiliency issues early in your
development cycle. By easily injecting network faults into your application’s
daily workflows, lueur encourages you to shift resiliency concerns to the left,
long before reaching production. The result: more confident engineering teams
and applications that gracefully handle the unexpected.

At its core, lueur acts as a local proxy you can route traffic through, giving
you fine-grained control over conditions like latency, jitter, and faults.
Rather than waiting until late-stage testing or worse, customer reports, you
can quickly see how your application responds when the network isn’t perfect.

**Why lueur?**

- **Speed:** Quickly stand up a local test environment with minimal setup.
- **Simplicity:** Just a few commands let you inject latency or run complex
  scenarios—no steep learning curve required.
- **Extensibility:** Tweak parameters, plug into automated tests, and integrate
  with your existing CI/CD pipelines.
- **Insight:** Generate structured reports that help pinpoint issues and
  identify ways to improve resiliency.

Take a look at the Tutorials, How-To Guides, Explanations, and Reference
sections to start exploring what lueur can do for your team.
