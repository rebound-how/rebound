# Scenario Analysis

This guide will show you how to analyze scenario results, from an
angle of resilience and reliability, using LLM.

The analysis aims at giving you a sound report of potential issues, threats
and remediations to consider for your application.

!!! abstract "Prerequisites"

    -   [X] Install lueur

        If you haven’t installed Lueur yet, follow the
        [installation instructions](../../install.md).

    -   [X] Get an OpenAI Key

        For the purpose of the guide, we will be using OpenAI models. You
        need to create an API key. Then make sure the key is available for
        lueur:

        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
        ```

    -   [X] Install a local qdrant database

        lueur uses [qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) for its vector database. You
        can install a [local](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/quickstart/),
        free, qdrant using docker:

        ```bash
        docker run -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 -v "$(pwd)/qdrant_storage:/qdrant/storage:z" qdrant/qdrant
        ```

!!! danger "Windows not supported"

    Unfortunately, the {==agent==} feature is not supported on Windows because
    the framework used by lueur to interact with LLM does not support that
    platform.

!!! info "Experimental feature"

    This feature is still experimental and is subject to change. Dealing with
    LLM requires accepting a level of fuzzyness and adjustments. Engineering
    is still very much a human endeavour!

## Review a Python Web Application

In this scenario we take a very basic Python application, using the
FastAPI and SQLAlchemy (sqlite) libraries. We want to learn what we can
from this application.

-   [X] Source code of the application

    ```python title="app.py"
    from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Column, Integer, String
    from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker, Session
    from sqlalchemy.exc import SQLAlchemyError

    # Database configuration
    DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"
    engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
    SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
    Base = declarative_base()

    # Define the User model
    class User(Base):
        __tablename__ = "users"

        id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
        name = Column(String, index=True)
        secret_password = Column(String)

    # Create the database tables
    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)

    app = FastAPI(
        servers=[
            {"url": "http://localhost:9090", "description": "Staging environment"}
        ]
    )

    # Dependency to get the database session
    def get_db():
        db = SessionLocal()
        try:
            yield db
        finally:
            db.close()

    @app.get("/")
    async def read_root():
        return {"message": "Hello, World!"}

    @app.post("/users/")
    async def create_user(name: str, secret_password: str, db: sessionmaker[Session] = Depends(get_db)):
        try:
            db_user = User(name=name, secret_password=secret_password)
            db.add(db_user)
            db.commit()
            db.refresh(db_user)
            return db_user
        except SQLAlchemyError as e:
            db.rollback()
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Database error occurred")

    @app.get("/users/{user_id}")
    async def read_user(user_id: int, db: sessionmaker[Session] = Depends(get_db)):
        try:
            user = db.query(User).filter(User.id == user_id).first()
            if user is None:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="User not found")
            return user
        except SQLAlchemyError as e:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Database error occurred")
    ```

    You may now install the dependencies to run it:

    === "pip"

        ```bash
        pip install fastapi sqlalchemy uvicorn
        ```

    === "uv"

        ```bash
        uv tool install fastapi sqlalchemy uvicorn
        ```

    Finally, run the application as follows:

    ```bash
    fastapi dev --port 9090
    ```

    This application has only a couple of endpoints is purposefully not
    optimised.

-   [X] Generate a scenario for this application

    We must first generate and run a scenario so we get a mapping of the
    application.

    ```bash
    lueur scenario generate --scenario scenario.yaml --spec-url http://localhost:9090/openapi.json
    ```

    ??? example "Generate scenario"

        The following scenario is created by lueur (we also trimmed it down to
        a single endpoint for clarity):

        ## Executive Summary
        
        **Findings**
        
        * Our current SQLite setup uses default durability (`DELETE` journal mode) and a single-threaded pool, limiting concurrent reads/writes and resilience under load.
        * Blocking DB calls have no per-call timeouts, risking orphaned threads and full thread‐pool exhaustion.
        * Transient SQL errors surface directly as user‐facing failures—there’s no structured retry for DB operations.
        * We rely on a synchronous client (`SQLAlchemy` + `sqlite3`), which can exacerbate latency spikes and resource contention.
        
        **Recommendations**
        
        1. **Enforce per-call timeouts on DB operations**  
           Cap query runtime (e.g. via `asyncio.wait_for` or driver‐level timeouts) to prevent slow queries from monopolizing threads.
        
        2. **Enable WAL with `synchronous=NORMAL` & tune checkpointing**  
           Switch to Write-Ahead Logging for better reader-writer concurrency and schedule regular `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` to bound WAL growth.
        
        3. **Add retry logic for transient DB failures**  
           Wrap all DB calls in `tenacity`-style exponential backoff (stop after ~3 attempts) to recover from brief locks or I/O hiccups.
        
        4. **Migrate to a server-based or async DB client**  
           Evaluate PostgreSQL/MySQL or an `asyncpg`-based driver to offload locking and I/O, improve scalability, and reduce blocking.
        
        **Key Trade-offs & Threats**
        
        * **Durability vs. Performance**: `synchronous=NORMAL` may lose sub-second commits on crash.
        * **Hidden Failures**: Excessive retries can mask schema drift, full-disk, or logic bugs.
        * **Premature Aborts**: Timeouts might kill valid long-running operations and leak threads.
        * **Migration Complexity**: New DB server or async stack introduces operational overhead and potential misconfiguration.
        
        **Next Steps & Validation**
        
        * **Fault Injection**:  
          Kill processes mid-commit to measure acceptable data-loss window.
        * **Load & Chaos Testing**:  
          Simulate heavy write loads and inject `SQLAlchemyError` to tune timeouts and backoff intervals.
        * **Monitoring & Alerts**:
          * Track 504 Gateway Timeout rates and thread-pool queue length
          * Monitor WAL file size, checkpoint lag, and “database is locked” errors
          * Expose retry count, retry latency, and ultimate failure rates
        
        Implementing these changes and validating them through targeted tests will significantly improve throughput, reliability, and predictability—while maintaining clear rollback paths.
        
        
        
        ## Overall Resilience Posture
        
        The root endpoint proved highly resilient—handling single and ramped latency spikes, jitter, packet loss, bandwidth throttling, and injected HTTP-500 errors with zero expectation failures or status-code breaches. The only SLO miss was under periodic 150–250 ms latency pulses (P95 > 300 ms), and a 1 s black-hole produced a few timeouts, suggesting targeted timeout/retry tuning for latency-critical paths.

        |• `GET /`|8|6|2|
        
        ## Potential Cause Hypotheses
        
        *Based on the periodic latency spikes and the 1 s black-hole on `GET /`, here are the most plausible, developer-actionable root causes*
        
        1. Thread-pool saturation from sync DB calls in async routes
           
           * Symptom mapping: tail-latency pulses on `GET /` (which is async, yet still experiences delay)
           * Hypothesis: even though `read_root()` is an `async def`, other endpoints (`/users/`) execute blocking SQLAlchemy calls in the default thread-pool executor. Under load, these threads become fully occupied, starving Uvicorn’s worker threads and delaying *all* incoming requests—including the root route—for short bursts.
        2. SQLite file-lock contention during concurrent writes
           
           * Symptom mapping: periodic 150–250 ms latency spikes and a single 1 s outage burst
           * Hypothesis: the app uses a single SQLite file without WAL or proper connection pool sizing. When many `POST /users/` commits hit the DB simultaneously, the underlying file lock serializes operations, causing some FastAPI workers to block until the lock is released. This serialization shows up as both tail-latency uplift and a black-hole when the lock persists.
        3. No per-call timeouts on blocking operations
           
           * Symptom mapping: prolonged service unavailability for the duration of the lock (≈1 s) rather than fast failure
           * Hypothesis: neither the SQLAlchemy engine nor the blocking calls in endpoints have explicit timeouts. When a write or commit stalls on I/O (e.g., lock contention or fsync), the request hangs indefinitely (up to the HTTP client timeout), magnifying the outage window and violating the p95/p99 latency SLOs.
        
        ## Recommendations
        
        *Actionable proposals to address DB thread‐pool saturation, SQLite lock contention, and lack of timeouts*
        
        Below are four targeted recommendation sets. Each includes PR-style diffs, priority levels, and a summary table to help you weigh cost, complexity, and expected benefits.
        
        ---
        
        ### 1. Enforce Per-Call Timeouts on Blocking DB Operations
        
        **Priority:** Critical  
        **Rationale:** Bounding each synchronous DB call prevents unbounded growth of the thread pool, protects the event loop under spikes, and converts “black-hole” waits into fast failovers.
        
        #### Proposed Changes

         async def create_user(
             name: str,
             secret_password: str,
             db: Session = Depends(get_db),
         ):
        -    try:
        -        db_user = User(name=name, secret_password=secret_password)
        -        db.add(db_user)
        -        db.commit()
        -        db.refresh(db_user)

        +    task = asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor(
        +        None, partial(_sync_create_user, db, name, secret_password)
        +    )
        +    try:
        +        return await asyncio.wait_for(task, timeout=5.0)
        +    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        +        # Abort long‐running or stuck operations
        +        raise HTTPException(status_code=504, detail="Database operation timed out")
        +    except SQLAlchemyError:
        +        db.rollback()
        +        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Database error occurred")
        
        +def _sync_create_user(db: Session, name: str, secret_password: str) -> User:
        +    """Helper: performs sync DB logic."""
        +    user = User(name=name, secret_password=secret_password)
        +    db.add(user)
        +    db.commit()
        +    db.refresh(user)
        +    return user
        ````
        
        **Discussion:**
        
        * `asyncio.wait_for` bounds each DB interaction to 5 seconds.
        * A timeout surfaces as a 504, preventing head‐of‐line blocking.
        * Moves sync logic into a dedicated helper (`_sync_create_user`).
        
        ---
        
        ### 2. Enable WAL & Tune SQLite Connection Parameters
        
        **Priority:** Recommended  
        **Rationale:** Write–read lock contention is drastically reduced with WAL mode and tuned timeouts, minimizing serialized commits under concurrency.
        
        #### Proposed Changes

         from sqlalchemy.pool import SingletonThreadPool
        
         DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./test.db"
        -engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
        +engine = create_engine(

        +        "timeout": 15,         # max wait for file lock
        +        "check_same_thread": False,
        +    },
        +    poolclass=SingletonThreadPool,  # serialize SQLite access
        +)
        
         # Enable WAL + relaxed sync on each new connection
         @event.listens_for(engine, "connect")
         def _set_sqlite_pragma(dbapi_conn, record):
             cursor = dbapi_conn.cursor()
             cursor.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;")
             cursor.execute("PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL;")
             cursor.close()
        
         SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
        ````
        
        **Discussion:**
        
        * `timeout` back-off reduces immediate “database is locked” errors.
        * `SingletonThreadPool` serializes access, preventing pool thrashing.
        * WAL journal and `synchronous=NORMAL` yield faster commits with minimal data‐loss risk.
        
        ---
        
        ### 3. Add Retry Logic for Transient DB Failures
        
        **Priority:** Recommended  
        **Rationale:** Brief file‐system or lock‐related errors surface as 500s; automatic retries with exponential back-off recover many of these without user impact.
        
        #### Proposed Changes
        
        ````diff
        --- a/app/crud.py

         @retry(
             retry=retry_if_exception_type(SQLAlchemyError),
             wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=0.5, max=2.0),
             stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
             reraise=True,
         )
         def _sync_create_user(db: Session, name: str, secret_password: str) -> User:
             user = User(name=name, secret_password=secret_password)
             db.add(user)
             db.commit()
             db.refresh(user)
             return user
        
         # no changes to the FastAPI endpoint signature;
         # retry is applied transparently in the helper
        ````
        
        **Discussion:**
        
        * Tenacity retries up to 3 times with exponential back-off on any `SQLAlchemyError`.
        * Many brief lock‐contention errors auto-resolve before surfacing a 500.
        
        ---
        
        ### 4. Long-Term: Migrate to Server-Based or Async DB Client
        
        **Priority:** Nice-to-have  
        **Rationale:** Eliminates SQLite’s file‐lock limitations and true async I/O avoids thread‐pool blockers. Consider Postgres/MySQL or an `asyncpg`/`databases` stack for high‐throughput writes.
        
        #### Example Snippet (using `databases`)
        
        ````python
        # install: pip install databases asyncpg
        
        import databases
        import sqlalchemy
        
        DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/appdb"
        database = databases.Database(DATABASE_URL)
        metadata = sqlalchemy.MetaData()
        
        users = sqlalchemy.Table(
            "users", metadata,
            sqlalchemy.Column("id", sqlalchemy.Integer, primary_key=True),
            sqlalchemy.Column("name", sqlalchemy.String),
            sqlalchemy.Column("secret_password", sqlalchemy.String),
        )
        
        engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine(DATABASE_URL)
        metadata.create_all(engine)
        
        app = FastAPI()
        
        @app.on_event("startup")
        async def startup():
            await database.connect()
        
        @app.on_event("shutdown")
        async def shutdown():
            await database.disconnect()
        
        @app.post("/users/")
        async def create_user(name: str, secret_password: str):
            query = users.insert().values(name=name, secret_password=secret_password)
            user_id = await database.execute(query)
            return { "id": user_id, "name": name }

        |Recommendation|Potential Business Risk|How It Can Materialize|Monitoring & Validation|
        |--------------|-----------------------|----------------------|-----------------------|
        |1. Enforce per-call timeouts on blocking DB operations|• User-facing 504s during traffic spikes<br>• Orphaned threads hogging the pool, causing broader slowdowns|• Legitimate bulk writes exceed 5 s → automatic abort → 504s<br>• Threads stuck in OS I/O linger indefinitely|• Track 504 Gateway Timeout rate<br>• Instrument thread-pool queue length and active threads (APM, `psutil`)<br>• Run load tests with slow queries to tune timeout|
        |2. Enable WAL & tune SQLite connection parameters|• Looser durability (lost last-millisecond writes on crash)<br>• WAL file growth filling disk<br>• Latency spikes under heavy writes|• Power loss before WAL checkpoint flush drops recent transactions<br>• WAL > disk quota → DB write errors<br>• Many concurrent writers queue up|• Monitor WAL file size and checkpoint frequency (`PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`) <br>• Alert on “database is locked” or disk-full errors<br>• Measure p50/p99 write latencies under load|
        |3. Add retry logic for transient DB failures|• Genuine errors masked (schema drift, full disk)<br>• Increased CPU/I/O during systemic failures, raising costs|• Continuous retries on misconfiguration stall service<br>• Retry storms amplify outage impact|• Expose metrics: retry count, retry latency, ultimate failures<br>• Alert if retries > 5% of requests<br>• Inject transient `SQLAlchemyError` in staging to validate back-off behavior|
        |4. Migrate to server-based or async DB client|• Migration complexity leading to production incidents<br>• New single point of failure or network latency issues|• Botched data migration causes downtime<br>• Async client misconfiguration leaks connections under load|• Canary rollout with shadow reads/writes<br>• Run end-to-end latency benchmarks vs. current baseline<br>• Build rollback scripts and test in staging|

        ### Detailed Threats & Next Steps
        
        1. Enforce per-call timeouts on blocking DB operations  
           • Business risk/trade-off  
           – Premature 504s degrade user experience for valid but slow operations  
           – Orphaned threads may accumulate if underlying calls ignore cancellation  
           • Next steps / tests  
           – Load-test with varying query complexities to find optimal timeout  
           – Monitor thread pool metrics via APM or `psutil`  
           – Implement safeguards to kill or recycle stuck threads after timeout
        
        2. Enable WAL & tune SQLite connection parameters  
           • Business risk/trade-off  
           – `synchronous=NORMAL` may lose last-written transactions on crash  
           – WAL file growth can fill storage if checkpoints lag  
           • Next steps / tests  
           – Schedule periodic checkpoints and monitor WAL size  
           – Simulate power-failure scenarios to measure acceptable data loss window  
           – Generate concurrent writes (e.g., 100× clients) and chart p50/p99 latencies
        
        3. Add retry logic for transient DB failures  
           • Business risk/trade-off  
           – Retries may hide underlying bugs or data corruption issues  
           – Excessive retries increase load during broader outages  
           • Next steps / tests  
           – Expose custom metrics for retry attempts, back-off intervals, and ultimate failures  
           – Alert when retry rate or cumulative retry latency exceeds threshold  
           – Conduct chaos tests by injecting `SQLAlchemyError` and verify exponential back-off
        
        4. Migrate to server-based or async DB client  
           • Business risk/trade-off  
           – Migration introduces complexity: schema conversion, connection pooling, error handling changes  
           – New async stack adds a learning curve and potential misconfigurations  
           • Next steps / tests  
           – Perform canary deployments with partial traffic routing  
           – Validate data consistency with shadow reads/writes against existing SQLite  
           – Benchmark end-to-end request latency and scale tests before full cutover
        
        By continuously tracking these metrics, running targeted failure scenarios in staging, and maintaining clear rollback paths, you can ensure each mitigation delivers real resilience improvements without introducing new business risks.
