      <h3>Reliably's obligations</h3>
      <p>Reliably undertakes that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the Reliably Product will perform substantially in accordance with the
          Documentation; and
        </li>
        <li>
          the Reliably Services will be performed with reasonable skill and
          care.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The undertaking at clause 12.1 shall not apply to the extent of any
        non-conformance which is caused by use of the Reliably Product contrary
        to Reliably's instructions, or modification or alteration of the
        Reliably Product by any party other than Reliably or Reliably's duly
        authorised contractors or agents, or the Customer’s failure to promptly
        install any update, upgrade, new version or new release of the Software
        released by Reliably, or any other non-conformance caused by the
        Customer’s acts or omissions. If the Reliably Product does not conform
        with the foregoing undertaking, Reliably will, at its expense, use all
        reasonable commercial endeavours to correct any such non-conformance
        promptly, or provide the Customer with an alternative means of
        accomplishing the desired performance. Such correction or substitution
        constitutes the Customer's sole and exclusive remedy for any breach of
        the undertaking set out in clause 12.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
        Reliably:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          does not warrant that the Customer's use of the Reliably Product will
          be uninterrupted or error-free; or that the Reliably Product and/or
          the information obtained by the Customer through the Reliably Product
          will meet the Customer's requirements; and

        <li>
          is not responsible for any delays, delivery failures, or any other
          loss or damage resulting from the transfer of data over communications
          networks and facilities, including the internet, and the Customer
          acknowledges that the Reliably Product may be subject to limitations,
          delays and other problems inherent in the use of such communications
          facilities.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This Contract shall not prevent Reliably from entering into similar
        agreements with third parties, or from independently developing, using,
        selling or licensing documentation, products and/or services which are
        similar to those provided under this Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reliably warrants that it has and will maintain all necessary licences,

      <h3>Customer's obligations</h3>
      <p>The Customer shall:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          provide Reliably with:
          <ol>
            <li>
              full co-operation and assistance in relation to this Contract; and
            </li>
            <li>
              access to all information and data as may be reasonably required
              by Reliably,
            </li>
          </ol>
          in order for Reliably to perform its obligations under this Contract;
        </li>
        <li>
          allow Reliably access to the Customer’s premises and Customer System
          as reasonably required by Reliably to perform the Reliably Services;
        </li>
        <li>
          without affecting its other obligations under this Contract, comply
          with all applicable laws and regulations with respect to its
          activities under this Contract;
        </li>
        <li>
          carry out all the Customer’s responsibilities set out in this Contract
          in a timely and efficient manner. In the event of any delays by the

          schedule as reasonably necessary;
        </li>
        <li>
          ensure that the Authorised Users use the Reliably Product, the
          Documentation and the Reliably Services in accordance with this
          Contract and shall be responsible for any Authorised User's breach of
          this Contract;
        </li>
        <li>
          ensure that the Customer System complies with the relevant
          specifications provided by Reliably from time to time; and
        </li>
        <li>
          be solely responsible for procuring, maintaining and securing its
          network connections and telecommunications links from the Customer
          System to Reliably's data centres, and for all problems, conditions,
          delays, delivery failures and all other loss or damage arising from or
          relating to the Customer System or telecommunications links or caused
          by the internet.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Whilst Reliably may provide the Customer with advice, recommendations
        and other services related to the Experiments, the Customer agrees that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          it is the Customer’s sole responsibility to select, create and run the
          most appropriate Experiments based on the Customer’s detailed
          understanding of the Customer’s business and the Customer System; and
        </li>
        <li>
          Reliably shall not be responsible for, and shall have no liability to
          the Customer for, the selection, creation or running of the
          Experiments by the Customer.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Customer warrants and represents on an ongoing basis that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          all software code, materials and other items created by the Customer
          in connection with the Customer’s use of the Reliably Product are the
          Customer’s original work, have not been copied (wholly or
          substantially) from any other source, and that the Customer’s (or any
          other person’s) use of them will not infringe the Intellectual
          Property Rights of any third party; and
        </li>
        <li>
          the use of any software code, materials or other items used, provided
          or made available by the Customer in connection with the Reliably
          Product or the Reliably Services will not infringe the Intellectual
          Property Rights of any third party.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Customer shall indemnify Reliably for all claims, costs, damage and
        expenses (including reasonable legal expenses) incurred by Reliably as a
        result of the Customer’s breach of clause 13.3.
      </p>
      <h3>Use of experiments in live environment</h3>
      <p>The Customer acknowledges that:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the Experiments can cause serious damage to the Customer System and
          the Customer’s business (including IT system and software failures and
          outages) so they must be used in a Sandbox Environment and must not be
          used in a Live Environment; and
        </li>
        <li>
          if the Customer uses the Experiments in a Live Environment in breach
          of clause 14.1.1, the Customer does so entirely at its own risk and
          Reliably shall have no liability to the Customer as a result of the
          Customer’s use of the Experiment in a Live Environment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Charges and payment</h3>
      <p>
        The Customer shall pay Reliably the Charges set out in the Order Form
        (or, if not set out there, Reliably’s standard charges for the Reliably
        Product and the Reliably Services).
      </p>
      <p>
        Reliably shall invoice the Customer for the Charges at the frequency set

        of the invoice.
      </p>

        and without prejudice to any other rights and remedies available to
        Reliably, Reliably may:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          disable the Customer's password, account and access to all or part of
          the Reliably Product and Reliably shall be under no obligation to
          provide any or all of the Reliably Product while the invoice(s)
          concerned remain unpaid;
        </li>
        <li>
          require the Customer and the Authorised Users to stop accessing and
          using all or part of the Reliably Product (and the Customer shall
          immediately comply, and shall ensure the Authorised Users immediately
          comply, with the requirement);
        </li>
        <li>suspend performance of the Reliably Services; and</li>
        <li>
          charge the Customer interest on a daily basis on such due amounts at
          an annual rate equal to 5% over the then current base lending rate of
          Bank of England from time to time, commencing on the due date and
          continuing until fully paid, whether before or after judgment.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>All amounts due under this Contract:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>shall be payable in pounds sterling;</li>
        <li>are non-cancellable and non-refundable; and</li>
        <li>
          are exclusive of value added tax, which shall be added to Reliably's
          invoice(s) at the appropriate rate.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Reliably shall be entitled to increase the Charges at the start of each
        Renewal Period upon at least 120 days' prior written notice to the
        Customer.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Each Party shall ensure that the other's Confidential Information to

      <p>The Customer acknowledges that notwithstanding this clause 17:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Indemnity</h3>
      <p>
        Reliably shall indemnify the Customer for and against any claim that the
        Reliably Product infringes any United Kingdom patent effective as of the
        Commencement Date, copyright, trade mark, database right or right of
        confidentiality, provided that:
      </p>

        <li>
          the Customer provides reasonable co-operation to Reliably in the

        Business Days' notice to the Customer without any additional liability
        or obligation to pay damages or other costs to the Customer.
      </p>
      <p>
        In no event shall Reliably, its employees, agents and sub-contractors be

          the Customer's use of the Reliably Product after notice of the alleged
          or actual infringement from Reliably or any appropriate authority.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>

      <h3>General</h3>
      <p>
        Except for the non-payment of any sums due under this Contract, neither

      </p>
      <p>

      <h3>Data Protection</h3>
      <p>
        The parties acknowledge that for the purposes of the Data Protection
        Legislation:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          the parties are independent controllers of all Personal Data received
          by Reliably in connection with the setting up, administration and
          management of the Authorised User’s accounts for the Reliably Product;
          and
        </li>
        <li>
          the Customer is the controller and Reliably is the processor of all
          Personal Data processed through the Reliably Product in connection
          with the Experiments. The Annex to this Schedule sets out the scope,
          nature and purpose of processing by Reliably, the duration of the
          processing and the types of personal data and categories of data
          subject.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Customer will ensure that it has all necessary appropriate consents
        and notices in place to enable lawful transfer of the personal data to
        Reliably for the duration and purposes of this Contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reliably shall, in relation to any personal data processed on behalf of
        the Customer:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          process that personal data only on the documented written instructions
          of the Customer unless Reliably is required by applicable laws to
          otherwise process that personal data. Where Reliably is relying on the
          laws of a member of the European Union or European Union Law as the
          basis for processing personal data, Reliably shall promptly notify the
          Customer of this before performing the processing required by the
          applicable laws unless those applicable laws prohibit Reliably from so
          notifying the Customer;
        </li>
        <li>
          ensure that it has in place appropriate technical and organisational
          measures to protect against unauthorised or unlawful processing of
          personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage
          to, personal data, appropriate to the harm that might result from the
          unauthorised or unlawful processing or accidental loss, destruction or
          damage and the nature of the data to be protected, having regard to
          the state of technological development and the cost of implementing
          any measures (those measures may include, where appropriate,
          pseudonymising and encrypting personal data, ensuring confidentiality,
          integrity, availability and resilience of its systems and services,
          ensuring that availability of and access to personal data can be
          restored in a timely manner after an incident, and regularly assessing
          and evaluating the effectiveness of the technical and organisational
          measures adopted by it);
        </li>
        <li>
          ensure that all personnel who have access to and/or process personal
          data are obliged to keep the personal data confidential; and
        </li>
        <li>
          not transfer any personal data outside of the United Kingdom or the
          European Economic Area unless the following conditions are fulfilled:
          <ol>
            <li>
              appropriate safeguards are provided in relation to the transfer;
            </li>
            <li>
              the data subject has enforceable rights and effective legal
              remedies;
            </li>
            <li>
              Reliably complies with its obligations under the Data Protection
              Legislation by providing an adequate level of protection to any
              personal data that is transferred; and
            </li>
            <li>
              Reliably complies with reasonable instructions notified to it in
              advance by the Customer with respect to the processing of the
              personal data.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          assist the Customer, at the Customer's cost, in responding to any
          request from a data subject and in ensuring compliance with its
          obligations under the Data Protection Legislation with respect to
          security, breach notifications, impact assessments and consultations
          with supervisory authorities or regulators;
        </li>
        <li>
          notify the Customer without undue delay on becoming aware of a
          personal data breach;
        </li>
        <li>
          at the written direction of the Customer, delete or return personal
          data and copies thereof to the Customer on termination of the Contract
          unless required by applicable law to store the personal data; and
        </li>
        <li>
          allow for audits by the Customer or the Customer's designated auditor
          and immediately inform the Customer if, in the opinion of Reliably, an
          instruction infringes the Data Protection Legislation.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The Customer consents to Reliably appointing third-party processors.
        Reliably shall inform the Customer of any changes to the third-party
        processors so the Customer has a reasonable opportunity to object to the
        change. Reliably shall enter into a written agreement with the
        third-party processor incorporating terms which are substantially
        similar to those set out in this Schedule. As between the Customer and
        Reliably, Reliably shall remain fully liable for all acts or omissions
        of any third-party processor appointed by it pursuant to this paragraph.
