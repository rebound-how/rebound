      <h3>About Us</h3>

      <p>
        ChaosIQ Limited, a company registered in England and Wales under company
        registration number 11438202, with our registered office at 80
        Cheapside, London, England, EC2V 6EE. We refer to ourselves
        as “Reliably” in this privacy section.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is Reliably's policy to respect your privacy regarding any
        information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy
        Policy applies to
        <a href="https://reliably.com/">https://reliably.com/</a>
        (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "https://reliably.com"). We respect your privacy
        and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may
        provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy
        Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how
        we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the
        information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information
        we collect through the Website and does not apply to our collection of information
        from other sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy, together with the Terms and conditions posted on
        our Website, set forth the general rules and policies governing your use
        of our Website. Depending on your activities when visiting our Website,

      <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
      <p>
        Like most website operators, Reliably collects
        non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
        servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
        preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor
        request. Reliably's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
        information is to better understand how Reliably's visitors use its
        website. From time to time, Reliably may release
        non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
        publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reliably also collects potentially personally-identifying information
        like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users
        leaving comments on https://reliably.com blog posts. Reliably only
        discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same
        circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.
      </p>

      <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>
        Certain visitors to Reliably's websites choose to interact with Reliably
        in ways that require Reliably to gather personally-identifying
        information. The amount and type of information that Reliably gathers
        depends on the nature of the interaction.
      </p>

      <h3>Security</h3>
      <p>
        The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
        remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
        electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially
        acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot
        guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>

      <p>

        us. If you click on a third party link, you will be directed to that
        third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
        and terms and conditions of every site you visit.

        services available at Reliably's website, and (ii) that have agreed not
        to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
        affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by
        using Reliably's website, you consent to the transfer of such
        information to them. Reliably will not rent or sell potentially

        necessary to protect the property or rights of Reliably, third parties
        or the public at large.
