**Arguments**

| Name       | Type   | Default | Required | Title      | Description                                  |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **repo**   | string |         | Yes      | Repository |                                              |
| **base**   | string | "main"  | No       | Branch     |                                              |
| **window** | string | "5d"    | No       | Window     | Select PRs within the given time window only |

Get a list of opened pull-requests durations.

If you donâ€™t set a window (by setting window to None), then it returns the duration of all PRs that were ever opened in this repository. Otherwise, only return the durations for PRs that were opened or closed within that window.

The repo should be given as owner/repo and the window should be given as a pattern like this: `<int>s|m|d|w` (seconds, minutes, days, weeks).

**Signature**

```python
def pr_duration(repo: str,
                base: str = 'main',
                window: Optional[str] = '5d',
                configuration: Dict[str, Dict[str, str]] = None,
                secrets: Dict[str, Dict[str, str]] = None) -> List[float]:
    pass

```
