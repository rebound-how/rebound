  ðŸŽ¥ Checking your observability and communication platforms with Reliably
description: |
  In this video, we will use a chaos engineering experiment, that we expect to 
  fail, to verify our open tracing and communication platforms are correctly 
  set up. Using the Honeycomb and Slack integrations provided by Reliably, we 
  will send traces and messages and observe if they are triggered as expected.
