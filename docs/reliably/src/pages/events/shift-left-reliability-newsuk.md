Starting small and currently serving billions of requests per month is never an easy path. Stoyan Yanev, Principal Engineer and Krasimir Petrov, Senior Software Engineer at News UK will show how they built their infrastructure and the decisions and compromises that had to be made along the way.

The talk will be centered around NewsKits API and the importance of Reliability before opening up a discussion among the group.

NewsKits API is a design system that provides interactive building blocks and guidelines for crafting cohesive digital product interfaces and accelerating development. It is built based on the idea of federated GraphQL architecture powered by Apollo Server and Apollo Federation.
