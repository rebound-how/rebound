Traditional approaches to gender equity see gender in a single silo.

Ignoring other inequities means our endeavours end up focusing on white, middle class, heterosexual, cis gender, non-disabled women, erasing the experiences and struggles of women who exist across multiple silos. What we do know is that the mainstream paradigm that silos people’s identities is redundant (you know, the common refrain that says: let's focus on "gender" first, and then when that's "done" we can look into race).

Sal Kimmich, developer advocate at Reliably, will give a talk at this event.
