Join us online for a community get together where we will be hearing real life stories from those leveraging Chaos Toolkit!

As existing Chaos Toolkit users, you’ll already understand the value of proactively identifying weaknesses and improving system resilience.

In our October session, hear how you can effectively orchestrate advanced experiments using ChaosToolkit and Terraform.

In our first talk we delve into the challenges of implementing chaos engineering when your infrastructure isn't initially prepared for it. We explore how pairing Chaos Toolkit with an infrastructure automation tool, like Terraform, can help orchestrating more advanced chaos experiments.

Manuel Castellin, a seasoned expert in Chaos Engineering and Terraform with years of hands-on experience in deploying and managing infrastructure, will be taking us through two real-world examples demonstrating how to overcome these challenges and securely experiment on production systems.

## Implementing Chaos Engineering in unprepared infrastructures

Implementing chaos engineering can be daunting when your infrastructure isn't chaos-ready from the start. Manuel will discuss the hurdles involved in orchestrating chaos experiments under such circumstances and take us through the advantages of pairing Chaos Toolkit with an infrastructure automation tool such as Terraform to simplify the execution of intricate experiments. This pairing streamlines the chaos engineering process, making it more accessible and efficient.

He’ll demonstrate a couple of real world examples so that by the end of this session you’ll see how to leverage automation tools to enhance the reliability and security of your experiments.

Real-World Example #1: Learn how to temporarily deploy supporting resources for your chaos experiments using ‘chaotoolkit-terraform’. Many experiments require additional resources to run successfully. We demonstrate how to create these resources seamlessly to facilitate experiment execution.

Real-World Example #2: Understand how to experiment on production securely by targeting resource replicas. Experimenting on production systems can be risky, but by exploring a safer alternative by focusing on resource replicas this approach allows you to assess the resilience of your infrastructure without compromising the integrity of your live environment.
