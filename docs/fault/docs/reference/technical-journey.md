# My Technical Journey Through fault

## Where it all started

### A great DX starts with an easy install

### Oh boy, Python to rust is quite the jump

### Moving the dependency mess onto the maintainer

### Different yet so similar

## Coding is about figuring out your next move

### Learning about rust basics

### Traits and fun

### Async in rust can be cumbersome

### I'm cloning too much aren't I?

### My code is dead ugly

### So much refactoring

### Finally something that runs

### More refactoring? Sure, why not?

## Bring on the features

### A proxy has a core feature

### Let's bring automation to developers, aka shift left reliability

### Scheduling a bit of a detour

### JSON is for machines, not for people

### Can we push the automation further?

## Deploying has to happen at some point, am I right?
