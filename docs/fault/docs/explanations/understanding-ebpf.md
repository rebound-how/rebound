# Understanding eBPF and its Context In Reliability Engineering

eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filter) is a powerful, flexible technology built
into the Linux kernel. It allows developers to run custom programs safely and
efficiently in kernel space. In the context of reliability engineering, eBPF
opens up new possibilities for monitoring, tracing, and manipulating network
traffic without having to modify your application or its configuration.

## eBPF in a nutshell

eBPF is a technology that enables the execution of sandboxed programs in the
Linux kernel. These programs can:

- **Monitor and trace system calls:** Allowing deep insights into application behavior.
- **Filter network packets:** Making it possible to capture or modify traffic dynamically.
- **Collect performance metrics:** Helping to identify bottlenecks or anomalies in real-time.

Because these programs run inside the kernel, they operate with minimal overhead
and at high speed, making eBPF an ideal choice for advanced observability and
fault injection tasks.

## How fault Uses eBPF in Stealth Mode

Traditionally, directing traffic through a proxy requires explicit configuration
(e.g., setting the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable). <span class="f">fault</span>'s stealth mode,
powered by eBPF, takes a different approach:

- **Transparent Traffic Capture:**  
  <span class="f">fault</span> leverages eBPF to intercept connection attempts at the kernel level.  
- **Seamless Integration:**  
  With eBPF, there's no need to reconfigure your applications or network clients. The traffic is transparently rerouted through <span class="f">fault</span>'s TCP proxy, allowing you to inject faults without modifying client behavior.

## Benefits for Reliability Engineering

Leveraging eBPF in this way offers several advantages for engineers focused on building reliable systems:

- **Zero-Configuration Overhead:**  
  Since there's no need to explicitly set up a proxy in your applications, integrating fault injection into your workflow is simpler and less error-prone.
- **Transparent Testing:**  
  Faults are injected without any changes to the application code or environment variables. This means you can test how your application behaves under realistic conditions.


## Limitations and Future Directions

- **Linux-Only Support:**  
  Currently, fault’s stealth mode using eBPF is available only on Linux. Other operating systems do not yet support eBPF, limiting this approach to Linux environments.
- **Kernel Complexity:**  
  Although eBPF programs are designed to be safe, working at the kernel level requires careful tuning and an advanced understanding of the Linux networking stack.

## Conclusion

Integrating eBPF into your reliability engineering practices with <span class="f">fault</span> opens up a new, transparent way to simulate network faults. By capturing and manipulating traffic at the kernel level, you can inject faults without altering your application’s configuration, a more realistic, production-like testing environment.

As you embrace these advanced techniques, you’ll gain deeper insights into your system’s behavior under stress and be better equipped to build resilient, high-performance applications.
