# How to Simulate HTTP Errors Using <span class="f">fault</span>

This guide will walk you through emulating application level HTTP errors into your
application using <span class="f">fault</span> proxy capabilities.

??? abstract "Prerequisites"

    -   [X] Install <span class="f">fault</span>

        If you havenâ€™t installed <span class="f">fault</span> yet, follow the
        [installation instructions](../../install.md).

    -   [X] Basic Proxy Setup
        Be familiar with running `fault run` {==--with-[fault]==} commands from
        your terminal.

!!! warning

    Currently HTTP errors can only be applied against HTTP proxy forwarding
    traffic. It doesn't work yet with tunneling traffic. The reason is that,
    when fault use the tunneling approach the network streams are opaque to
    fault. Therefore it cannot figure the protocol going though. One could
    write a [plugin](./extending.md) to achieve this but it's not a core feature
    yet.

    This HTTP error work against forward proxying but not tunneling proxy nor
    raw TCP proxies.

## Constant Internal Server Error

-   [X] Start the proxy with HTTP Error 500 from the remote server

    ```bash
    fault run \
        --with-http-response \ # (1)!
        --http-response-status 500 \ # (2)!
        --http-response-trigger-probability 1  # (3)!
    ```

    1.  Enable the HTTP error fault support
    2.  Set the {==status==} to 500
    3.  Set the error on all responses

## Intermittent Service Unavailable Errors

-   [X] Start the proxy with HTTP Error 503 from the remote server

    ```bash
    fault run \
        --with-http-response \ # (1)!
        --http-response-status 503 \ # (2)!
        --http-response-trigger-probability 0.5  # (3)!
    ```

    1.  Enable the HTTP error fault support
    2.  Set the {==status==} to 503
    3.  Set the error on half of the responses

## Intermittent Not Found Errors

-   [X] Start the proxy with HTTP Error 404 from the remote server

    ```bash
    fault \
        --with-http-response \ # (1)!
        --http-response-status 404 \ # (2)!
        --http-response-trigger-probability 0.5 \ # (3)!
        --http-response-body '{"error": "true"}' # (4)!
    ```

    1.  Enable the HTTP error fault support
    2.  Set the {==status==} to 404
    3.  Set the error on half of the responses
    4.  Set a JSON response body
