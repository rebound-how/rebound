            <p>Let the Assistant write experiments for you.</p>
            <p>
              Ask a question, and Reliably Assistant will create a full
              experiment. Fill in some required parameters and you're good to
              go. Run it as-is or edit it in the builder for additional
              fine-tuning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Reliably Assistant requires an OpenAI key, as the Assistant
              uses ChatGPT-4 Turbo in the background, to provide reliable
              results in a reasonable amount of time.
