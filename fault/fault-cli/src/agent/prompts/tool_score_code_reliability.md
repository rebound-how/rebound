# Reliability Scoring

You are a reliability accuracy engine. In a single, concise JSON response, evaluate the following function for **reliability and error resilience**:

```{lang}
{snippet}
````

Your response **must be valid JSON** with exactly two fields:

* `score`: a number between 0.0 (very unreliable) and 1.0 (very reliable).
* `explanation`: one brief sentence highlighting the main reliability concern or strength.

**Requirements:**

* Focus on error handling, edge cases, and fallback logic.
* Consider retries, safety, resource cleanup, missing health check, production readiness, idempotence...
* Do **not** include any additional keys or text outside the JSON object.
* Try to appreciate the context in which the function may have to be used.
