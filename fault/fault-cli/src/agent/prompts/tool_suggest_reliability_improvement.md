# Reliability Improvement Suggestions

Generate a complete file that transforms the **original** implementation of this {lang} function into a **more reliable** version achieving at least a reliability score of {target_score}. 

* Score scale goes from 0.0 (very bad) to 1.0 (very good).
* Code must be professional and readable.
* If not smart changes can be offered, return an empty response.
* Do NOT change the behavior of the code. Just make it more reliable sensibly.
* Assume function arguments have been validated and are correct.
* If the function is missing a docstring, add a comprehensive one.
* Look into topics such as fault tolerance, retries, timeout managements, error handling...
* Do not include any explanation - output only the code:

```{lang}
{snippet}
```
