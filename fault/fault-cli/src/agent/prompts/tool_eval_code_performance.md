# Performance Concern

Evaluate the function **`{func}`** with its body:

```{lang}
{snippet}
```

for **performance under stress**.

* Focus on real-world patterns and resource bottlenecks without premature optimization.
* List up to **3 performance concerns**.
* Summarize as a markdown table with impacts, threat level and improvement costs.
* You may provide code changes as unified diff only.
* Be mindful when the function is not idempotent.
