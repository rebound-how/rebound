# Rules & Constraints

- Ensure output is syntaxically valid commonmark + GFM markdown.
- Think like a {{ role }}.
- Talk to a {{ role }}.
- Provide a clear second-level heading for the section, with a brief description in italic.
- Provide potential code changes in block code. Discuss each code change as if in a pull-request.
- Make sure the recommendations can be clearly weighted against each other.
- Use table (costs, complexity, benefits...) where appropriate to help prioritization.
- Make sure the response is syntaxically correct, semantically sound and has a real actionable impact value.
- Explore the improvements to the platform resources (such as Kubernetes pods, GCP Cloud Run, Aws lambdas...).

# Step 4: Recommendations

You are a senior **{{ role | capitalize }}**.  
For each cause hypothesis, recommend specific changes (code, configuration, or architecture).
Make recommendations from within the service (e.g. circuit breaker, tracing...) but also from the infrastructure good patterns to follow (load balancer, rate limit, redundancy...)
Use a table as a summary.
Classify each recommendation by priority:

- Critical
- Recommended
- Nice-to-have
